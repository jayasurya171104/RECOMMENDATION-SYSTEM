## DESCRIOTON OF MY PROJECT

System
ðŸ“Œ Task Title
Build a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering or Matrix Factorization

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To develop a machine learning-based Recommendation System that can suggest relevant items (such as movies, products, etc.) to users by learning from historical user-item interaction data.

ðŸ“š Technologies Used
Python

Surprise Library (for SVD, collaborative filtering)

Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (for splitting data, evaluation)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

ðŸ§  Core Concepts Applied
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on similar users or items.

Matrix Factorization (SVD): Decomposes the user-item rating matrix into latent features to predict missing ratings.

Train-Test Splitting: Evaluate model on unseen user-item pairs.

Prediction & Evaluation: Accuracy measured using metrics like RMSE and MAE.

ðŸ”¨ Implementation Steps
Import Libraries
Use surprise for modeling, pandas and numpy for data processing.

Load Dataset
Load a ratings dataset (e.g., MovieLens or a CSV with UserID, ItemID, Rating).

Prepare Data
Use Reader and Dataset.load_from_df() to format the data.

Train-Test Split
Split the data using train_test_split() to evaluate generalization.

Build Model
Apply SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) from Surprise.

Train the Model
Fit the SVD model on the training data.

Predict & Evaluate
Generate predictions and evaluate them using RMSE or MAE.

ðŸ“ˆ Expected Output
A trained recommendation system capable of predicting how a user might rate an unseen item.

Model evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE).

Optional: top-N item recommendations for a specific user.
